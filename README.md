# resturant-management-app
In this application I had added a resturant management functionality using vue js version 3 npm 8.11.0 and node 16.16.0 so here I worked on like first user sign up himself then they can login and then all resturants are showing in list and then they can add, update and delete all resturants here I am using json-server for rest api's and local storage for store data.
